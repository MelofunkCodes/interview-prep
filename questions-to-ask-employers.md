# Questions To Ask Employers

This one I found I was able to come up with more questions once I wet my feet a bit and got some
work experience. Work is really like dating (hehe), and the more experience you get, the more you
know what you want in your next employer and what works for you/what doesn't. Not only are employers
looking to see if you could fit in with their company and team, but this is also the perfect 
opportunity for you to find out if they fit **for you**. Pew pew! 

Some of them may be a bit specific to me, 
 but maybe you may find useful (e.g., the first 2 questions), and some you may find you don't see 
 as important in what you're looking for. In interviews, I try to ask questions for stuff that 
 I still feel I'm learning to find the balance of, but am curious to see how more experienced devs
 approach it.

- How do you approach solving a problem? 
- What's your approach on when to ask questions? How do you [the more experienced dev] ask questions / ask for help? 
- How is the team like? Where is everyone from?
  - (*I find when you have a team of junior, intermediate, and senior devs, and they come from
  all over the world, it's a lot more voices, and different perspectives to solving problems, which
  I think is a good thing.* üòä) 
- How do you guys assess your team performance or completing tasks? What do you use to assess it? 
Agile, scrum, standup?
- What does success for the team/company mean to you?
- If you find that there's something that someone on your team can improve on, how do you tell them?
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Is there anything I'm lacking that would hold me back as a candidate?
