# Technical questions & Javascript Concepts

Sometimes an interviewer will test your knowledge of Javascript and programming fundamentals. In one of my first interviews, I received a bunch of questions straight from this list: [10 JS Interview Questions]. The article is very well written and I suggest you go through each question, taking the time to understand all the concepts, it will give you a much deeper knowledge of JS. 

Here's the questions:  

- Can you name two programming paradigms important for JavaScript app developers?
- What is functional programming?
- What is the difference between classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance?
- What are the pros and cons of functional programming vs object-oriented programming?
- When is classical inheritance an appropriate choice?
- When is prototypal inheritance an appropriate choice?
- What does “favor object composition over class inheritance” mean?
- What are two-way data binding and one-way data flow, and how are they different?
- What are the pros and cons of monolithic vs microservice architectures?
- What is asynchronous programming, and why is it important in JavaScript?
