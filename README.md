# Interview Prep

So now you've finished DecodeMTL, what now? 

You're following DecodeMTL's Job Guide, and pounding the pavement...you've submitted some CV's 
and cover letters, and now you have some interviews set up. Props!! ðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ (React props that is! ðŸ˜‰
`this.props.upTop = 'ðŸ™Œ';`)

Now to prepare for the interview... dun dun dun! ðŸ˜± What questions will employers ask? What 
questions should **we** ask employers to make it look like we've come prepared and we know what we
want and are looking for? 

Fear not, my friend, you've come to the right place! (or one among many! 
The internet is a beautifulll place! And Google is your bae. ðŸ˜Ž)

Here are just some of the questions I've encountered from my interviews that employers have asked me
that I thought were good questions (and that I could've prepared better for), and vice versa!

And also, some of the coding challenges I've encountered. Even if you don't have an interview, but
are looking for a project to work on and add to your portfolio, play on! ðŸ¤˜ ðŸŽ¸

So I hope this helps, and for other alumnis, please feel free to pitch in if you've found other
questions/coding challenges that really tickled your noggin. 

May the Code be with you! ðŸ‘ŠðŸ¤“ðŸ’»
